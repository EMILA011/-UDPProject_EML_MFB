# Summary
This project is small Server and Client application that we build to experience how server and client work using UDP. UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol and is a connectionless network protocol. The first is a UDP server that will serve up quotations about programming. The second is a UDP client that will request quotations from the UDP Server.The UDP Server listens for requests in a loop; the UPD Client send requests in a loop until the user enters <END>. When the UDP Server receives a request, it sends a response to the client. The UPD Client receives the response and prints it in a console. Instruction are provided in line 6 to 12 on how to run the program. 

We both work on the project at an equal amounts. Elena was responsible for more of the debugging part and making sure thing were working correctly as asked, and as well making sure things were formated correctly and commenting all the codes. Michael was responsible for building the very blue print of the project and what the code should looks like.
